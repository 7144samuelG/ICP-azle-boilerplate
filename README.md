# `Hi Everyone`

Welcome to the smart contract project that I've created, which is a project of Student Council's President election system using blockchain. For this project, users will meet four options of candidates, where they can make a vote, and the number of voters for each candidate are stored in the blockchain system. 

This is a simulation project, so I plan to make users can vote many times, while actually in reality it is not possible. This multiple vote system by users are used to track the work mechanism of the system.
